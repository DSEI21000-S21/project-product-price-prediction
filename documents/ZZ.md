# III. Transformation, Feature Selection, and Modeling: 30pts

A. Did you transform, normalize, filter the data appropriately to solve your problem? Did you divide by max-min, or the sum, root-square-sum, or did you z-score the data? Did you justify what you did?

B. Did you justify normalization or lack of checking which works better as part of your hyper-parameters?

C. Did you explore univariate and multivariate feature selection? (if not why not)

D. Did you try dimension reduction and which methods did you try? (if not why not)

E. Did you include 1-2 simple models, for example with classification LDA, Logistic Regression or KNN?

F. Did you pick an appropriate set of models to solve the problem? Did you justify why these models and not others?

G. Did you try at least 4 models including one Neural Network Model using Tensor-Flow or Pytorch?

H. Did you exercise the data science models/problems we described in the lectures showing what was presented?

I. Are you using appropriate hyper-parameters? For example, if you are using a KNN regression are you investigating the choice of K and whether you use uniform or distance weighting? If you are using K-means do you explain why K? If you are using PCA do you explore how many dimensions such as by looking at the eigenvalues?


# Metrics, Validation and Evaluation 20pts

A. Are you using an appropriate choice of metrics? Are they well justified? If you are doing classification do you show a ROC curve? If you are doing regression are you justifying the metric least squares vs. mean absolute error? Do you show both?

B. Do you validate your choices of hyperparameters? For example, if you use KNN or K-means do you use cross-validation to optimize your choice of parameters?

C. Did you make sure your training and validation process never used the training data?

D. Do you estimate the uncertainty in your estimates using cross-validation?  

E. Can you say how much you are overfitting?
