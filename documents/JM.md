# Machine Learning Question: 20 pts

** A. Is the background context for the question stated clearly (with references)?

Mercari, Japan’s biggest community-powered shopping app, knows this problem deeply. They’d like to offer pricing suggestions to sellers, 
but this is tough because their sellers are enabled to put just about anything, or any bundle of things, on Mercari's marketplace.
We need to build an algorithm that automatically suggests the right product prices with the provided user-inputted text descriptions of their products, including details like product category name, brand name, and item condition.    

The reference is from kaggle. 

**B. Is the hypothesis/problem stated clearly ("The What")?

The hypothesis is description is the factor to be considered for determining  the price for the product. 


**C. Is it clear why the problems are important? Is it clear why anyone would care? ("The Why")


**D. Is it clear why the data were chosen should be able to answer the question being asked?4

**E. How new, non-obvious, significant are your problems? Do you go beyond checking the easy and obvious?

# Data Cleaning/Checking/Data Exploration: 20pts

**A. Did you perform a thorough EDA (points below included)?

**B. Did you check for outliers?

**C. Did you check the units of all data points to make sure they are in the right range?

**D. Did you identify the missing data code?

**E. Did you reformat the data properly with each instance/observation in a row, and each variable in a column?

**F. Did you keep track of all parameters and units?

**G. Do you have a specific code for formatting the data that does not require information not documented (eg. magic numbers)?

**H. Did you plot univariate and multivariate summaries of the data including histograms, density plots, boxplots?

**I. Did you consider correlations between variables (scatterplots)?

**J. Did you consider plot the data on the right scale? For example, on a log scale?

**K. Did you make sure that your target variables were not contaminating your input variables?

**L. If you had to make synthetic data was it a useful representation of the problem you were trying to solve?


# Visualization 10pts

**A. Do you provide visualization summaries for all your data and features?

**B. Do you use the correct visualization type, eg. bar graphs for categorical data, scatter plots for numerical data, etc?

**C. Are your axes properly labeled?

**D. Do you use color properly?

**E. Do you use opacity and dot size so that scatterplots with lots of data points are not just a mass of interpretable dots?

**F. Do you write captions explaining what a reader should conclude from each figure (not just saying what it is but what it tells you)?
